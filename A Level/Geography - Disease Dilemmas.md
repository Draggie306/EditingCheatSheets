All types of diseases can be categorised into distinct categories depending on how they spread, how frequently they spread, who they spread from and to, and how many people spread them.

**Communicable** diseases are diseases which spread from host to host through means such as direct contact, contact with contaminated material, through vectors or airborne particles. Broadly, these ones can spread.
**Non-communicable** diseases cannot be spread between people. These are a result of lifestyle choices and genetic factors

**Infectious** diseases are those which are spread by **pathogens** from any host to any host, with any form of contact. 
**Non-infectious** diseases cannot be caused by pathogens between hosts.

**Contagious** diseases are those which spread **between people** through direct or indirect contact.
 **Non-contagious** diseases cannot be transmitted from one person to another. However, they may include those transmitted through **vectors**.

For example:
- Malaria is communicable (can spread), infectious (spread by a parasite) but non-contagious (cannot go directly from person to person)
- Skin cancer is non-communicable (can't spread), non-infectious (not spread), and non-contagious (can't be caught from someone else)

In addition, diseases can be

#### Malaria

Malaria is an infectious, non-contagious disease. It is concentrated around the tropics, mostly in Africa, Central America and South/Southeast Asia - in other words, it is endemic to specific countries and epidemics can occur, but not pandemics. The Anopheles mosquito, which is the fector which transports the *Plasmodium* parasite, is most abundant in warm and humid environments, but not large urban areas. 

Facts:
- In 2018, 220 million people were infected with the disease.
- In total, there are 3.2 billion people at risk in 97 countries.
- It is estimated that half the world's population since the beginning has died from this disease.

#### HIV/AIDS

This is an infectious, contagious disease. 



## Case study: River flooding, Bangladesh

Bangladesh, bordered by India and Myanmar (synoptic link to Global Migration) is a deltaic country, situated on the world's largest river delta - the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. 

Flooding from this river is a significant part of the livelihoods of Bangladesh's population. **60% live in rural areas**, mostly in the primary (agricultural) sector; **80% of the land area benefits from the flooding extent**.  There are several hundred permanent waterways which move around a billion tonnes of fertile soil, fuelled by glacial ablation in the Himalayas (synoptic link to Glaciated Systems) where peak melting coincides with the monsoon season. On top of being low lying (the average elevation is just 9 metres; 10% is below sea level [2](https://en-ie.topographic-map.com/map-csnfcz/Bangladesh/), which leads to over **a third of the country's land area regularly flooding** in the monsoon season. [1](https://factsanddetails.com/south-asia/Bangladesh/Nature_Environment_Animals_Bangladesh/entry-8204.html)

This isn't all positive, however. In the short to medium term, climate change is exacerbating risks by increasing the volatility of glacial systems, increasing the magnitude of discharge and therefore magnitude of the flooding in these low-lying areas.

*percentage-of-area-inundated-in-Bangladesh*

In 2020, the monsoon rains were of unprecedented scale. In the first half of the monsoon season, 40% of the land was inundated. This led to an epidemic of various water-borne diseases, including hepatitis, diarrhoea, typhoid and cholera. Although only 83 people died, **1.3 million homes were damaged** (and 3/4 of a million flooded), **affecting 5.4 million people** (1 in 35 people) [4](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-monsoon-floods-final-report-n-mdrbd025). The amount of **crops destroyed was over 150,000 hectares**, [3](https://www.globalfloods.eu/get-involved/case-study-bangladesh-2020/) which has knock-on effects for future years: consecutive years with bad flooding can decrease communities' resilience due to less stored money from agriculture, especially true as **half of the Bangladeshi population live below the absolute poverty threshold** and this can increase the susceptibility to disease outbreaks with a lack of nutrition and strength to be able to fight diseases like diarrhoea which is especially deadly for children under 5 years old. As an LIDC, this is especially true: the population pyramid is swayed in favour of younger ages (5% are under 5, compared to the average in ACs which is 6x fewer). This was seen in Bangladesh with these floods: the contamination of water supplies such as wells resulted in 4,500 people becoming ill with diarrhoea alone. On top of this, just under 2,000 schools and educational facilities were destroyed in the floods too.

Bangladesh, although has its problems, is improving too. The threat of more severe flooding in future years and stronger cyclones has prompted both the government and NGOs to intervene. Female education and nutrition has significantly improved, with an emphasis on breastfeeding which reduces the likelihood of deadly waterborne diseases like diarrhoea being introduced into vulnerable babies' and children's immune systems. The Government allocated 14,410 tons of rice to be given to those affected. Oral rehydration solution was given to treat those moderately dehydrated, with water purification tablets being used to treat water supplies in large population centres, significantly reducing the risk of waterborne illness contamination and subsequent infection.

## Case study: Air pollution and cancer in India

India (Bharat), now the most populous country, is classified as an EDC with an HDI of 0.633 and a GNI of $7130 PPP. However, levels of air pollution in this expansive nation are... pretty bad. 21 of the 30 most polluted cities globally are in India. 99% of Indians breathe air with particulate matter above the WHO's "safe" levels of PM 2.5 concentrations of less than ten micrograms/m^3^. With a population of 1.4 billion, half of them are expected to live for three fewer years because of this - and some urban residents in the capital (New) Delhi and other cities like Hyderabad and Gurugram are expected to live for 5 or even 10 or more years shorter!

Over the past 2 decades, fine particle concentration has increased by 69% across India,

Air pollution here is largely caused by particulate matter, like NO~2~, S0~2~ and O~3~, emitted from vehicles, factories and coal-based factories. Biomass in rural areas also contributes to this: burning paraffin and animal excrement increases indoor air pollution so much that up to 1 million people die prematurely annually because of this. This is visible as **photochemical smog** - which can cause acid rain.

> PM 2.5 are particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometres in size, which can penetrate and remain persistently in the lungs and interfere with DNA, causing mutations like cancer and increasing the probability of other non-communicable and chronic illnesses. Bronchitis, asthma, lung cancer, and CVDs (heart disease)  

In many cities such as Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma. This is the highest worldwide.

In Delhi, PM 2.5s are at 24x the safe level - and increasing. A reduction to safe levels would benefit life expectancy more than eliminating unsafe water access and eliminating poverty, combined.

Air pollution is having a significant negative impact on India's economic output and various social factors. There is an added burden on healthcare systems to accommodate for lung cancers and other cardiovascular, chronic illnesses when the country has not fully made it out of the Age of Receding Pandemics (Stage 2) of the epidemiological transition model. The particulate matter at such high levels has an impact on the brain, reducing its function by several percent and potentially reducing educational attainment and the chances of students contributing to the economy through high-skilled employment. Even if they do, the reduced life expectancy will shorten the times they will be able to work, earn, spend and reinvest in the economy.

> Nearly 1.67 million deaths and an estimated loss of USD 28.8 billion worth of output were India's prices for worsening air pollution in 2019. ^[1]

Respiratory diseases are 1.7x higher in Delhi, with a 40% decrease in lung function because of air pollution. In addition, there are 20% more non-smoking-related lung cancer diagnoses each year, with a total of 1 in 68 males being diagnosed with this - in one year alone.

### Solutions

However, there is a silver lining to the smog cloud. Gujarat, a state in the west of the country, has set a legal limit on pollutant emissions for industrial plants. The government gives out a set amount of permits to companies, and should certain factories require more emissions, they must trade these permits to raise their emissions allowances. This financially incentivises businesses to invest in less emissive processing facilities, reducing air pollution, whilst providing a revenue stream for the local authority to tackle the effects of heightened levels of emissions, in addition to tackling a root cause of this through the trading permits. 
Petrol and diesel subsidies have been scrapped in some areas (these fuels power large amounts - 1/3 - of electrical production) and further, 14 Indian cities are expanding the use of high-speed metro systems - encouraging clean, fast public transport which reduces traffic congestion. 

In rural areas, zigzag brick kilns which reduce coal consumption by 80% have been fitted in various communities, despite slow progress. Burning stubble in fields - a huge smoke pollutant which wind frequently carries from rural to urban settlements, making up **17% of India's emissions** - is also in the process of having additional restrictions. 

Despite all of these advances, the introduction of legislation like this has been slow and there are greater priorities for the moment such as increasing living standards across the country - 15% are still living in multidimensional poverty. There is currently no legislation controlling levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide with vehicle emissions. Economic incentives to further grow the country's economy may be hampered if legislation like this is forcefully enacted, therefore, the government is betting that allowing significant economic development now will allow them to put laws in place in the future as the country develops, without being of detriment to all citizens.

### Global solutions to air problems

In 1997, there was the legally binding Kyoto Protocol. It created agreements on reducing carbon emissions around the world, such as by 2012 there will be 22% lower emissions. In comparison to 1990 in the EU, however, global carbon emissions increased by 65%! Despite this, the goal was achieved and even by 5% in the EU. This caused industries - directly or indirectly - to move and relocate away from the EU. Carbon trading systems were also considered too complex, would not help to reduce emissions, and only included those countries that had already been industrialised. 

In 2015, this protocol was replaced by the Paris Climate Convention. It agreed to reduce CO~2~ emissions below 60% of 2010 levels by 2050 and to keep global temperature rises below 2° C in comparison to the 1900 average. Ideally, this was set to 1.5°, but this is considered too difficult.

## Case study: Malaria in Ethiopia

Malaria, one of the world's most deadly diseases, is estimated to have killed around 5% of all humans who have ever lived [[1](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2019/10/03/has_malaria_really_killed_half_of_everyone_who_ever_lived.html)]. It is a communicable, infectious but non-contagious disease. More specifically, female Anopheles mosquitoes inoculate the Plasmodium parasite into humans - where it infects liver cells and then moves to red blood cells - with no other known hosts.

200 million cases of malaria were reported in sub-Saharan Africa to the WHO. In Ethiopia, 3/4 of the land area is considered endemic, putting 2/3 of the population (60 million) at risk of contracting the disease, where around 5 million cases are reported, alongside 70,000 deaths, per year. 

The epidemiology of malaria is unevenly distributed. Areas such as the Gambella region, situated to the west of the Ethiopian highland mountains (relief rainfall) is in a lowland area and malaria is endemic. This area, where humid and warm conditions mix with stagnant water pools provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In the highlands, where altitudes reach 2,200m
