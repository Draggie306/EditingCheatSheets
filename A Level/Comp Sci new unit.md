## Primitive data types, binary and hexadecimal
Primitive data types refer to the most basic type of data in a programming language
These include

- Strings
- Integers
- Real/float
- Char
- Boolean

This is different to composite data types and abstract data types

Conversion is simple.

Just remember the place values in hex - and the second hex digit is 16x the first one


45 = ?


1. 45 DIV 16 = 2
2. 45 MOD 16 = 13
3. 13 in hex = D
4. 2D

## ASCII and Unicode



## Binary Arithmetic

Whilst traditional binary numbers are easier and less resource-intensive to compute, they lack the ability to have greater precision to more accurately represent a wider range of numbers, such as literally any number with a decimal. As a result we imposition a decimal point - or binary point - on the binary weighted number line. Numbers above this point are greater tha


## Floating point arithmetic

Floating point arithmetic numbers are better in some scenarios versus using fixed-point implementations of data representation. 


## Bitwise manipulation and masks
