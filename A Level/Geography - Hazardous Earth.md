## 3-marker limitation questions
To answer these questions, firstly understand what the question is asking. For example:
> "Identify three limitations of Fig. 5 (graph) as a source of information about earthquakes occurring in Iran."

This is effectively asking about how well it is a **source of information about earthquakes**. Therefore your answer must be about earthquake information and that's it. Therefore, you should consider the properties of earthquakes, their effects, responses and more. For example, does the figure:
- Not contain essential **information**? This could be the magnitude, focus, people affected by it, why that specific location. If it is a map, why that area? Geology?
- Have a completely understandable **scale**? Pick out a year/month and can you get a precise reading? Is it going up in regular, precise intervals or random numbers of years?
- Have a reliable **source**? Is it from the USGS, the UNDRR, the EU?
