## Primitive data types, binary and hexadecimal
Primitive data types refer to the most basic type of data in a programming language
These include

- Strings
- Integers
- Real/float
- Char
- Boolean

This is different to composite data types and abstract data types

Conversion is simple.

Just remember the place values in hex - and the second hex digit is 16x the first one


45 = ?


1. 45 DIV 16 = 2
2. 45 MOD 16 = 13
3. 13 in hex = D
4. 2D

## ASCII and Unicode



## Binary Arithmetic


### Fixed-point binary
Whilst traditional binary numbers are easier and less resource-intensive to compute, they lack the ability to have greater precision to more accurately represent a wider range of numbers, such as literally any number with a decimal. As a result we imposition a decimal point - or binary point - on the binary weighted number line. Numbers above this point (to its left) are greater than one, and numbers below (to the right) are smaller than one (but greater than zero).

As the decimal point is fixed in place, it may or may not be able to represent the target data without any rounding errors.

## Floating point arithmetic

Floating point arithmetic numbers are better in some scenarios versus using fixed-point implementations of data representation. 

Floating point representation allows the binary point to move along a set length of possible bits, like a byte. 
This therefore enables the trade off between
